JETMAN JR
-------------

Use your jetpack to explore caverns! Destroy your enemies with lasers and dynamites. Your mission: to find the
old git that got lost exploring the caverns looking for treasure. Find him, Jetman. Be the hero!

The idea behind this game is about branching. Very loosely of course. 
After the inital tutorial level, you are presented with a screen that branches away into three
separate routes (and one that just leads to your untimely death). They all take you to a final level
where you will eventually find "old man git". 

Installation
-------------
Clone and point a your localhost to the folder that was created. To play the game, run index.html, which links
to the minified version of the game. 
The game files are located in lib/games. To run the unminified game you also need a copy of the impactjs game
engine.
