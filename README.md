Clone and point a your localhost to the folder that was created. To play the game, run index.html, which links

The game code for Reverse Space Invaders is released under non-commercial BSD (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), which means you're free to fork it, develop and release new versions for non-commercial use. I reserve

The game uses ImpactJS, which has a separate license. To run and compile this game, you need the impactjs game 
engine (which should be placed under lib/). 

I strongly encourage  and appreciate pull requests for the current game, and would be delighted 
to hear from anyone who decide to create a new version of the game.
